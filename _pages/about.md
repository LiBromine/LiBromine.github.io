<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Jianfei Chen](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianfei/). 
I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology, and Pure and Applied Mathematics (second degree), at Tsinghua University in 2022.

My research interests include machine learning systems, graph mining systems and high performance computing.
